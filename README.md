# ML projects 
  - Here I will code and results for some of the real life projects (no MNIST, IRIS etc.,)
    basically, projects which are new. 
  - All the projects will have their own README file etc., so not writing much here.

  - Note that here the data may be real or simulated but the problem will be new. 

  - In case find this useful please give your feedback.
